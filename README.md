HTML, java script and styling for challenge 04

## Description
This is an online quiz to test how knowledgeable a user in coding basics.
It will show how much time is left per question and how many they got correct,
as well as provide them the correct answer if they answer a question wrong. (I am unsure how to get their score text box at the end to appear. I followed the below tutorial and I can't seem to see where I went wrong.
